## Literal vs Constant  

A **literal** is a value that expressed as itself rather than as a variable's value or the result of an expression,  
such as number `3` or the string `"hello"`.  
A **constant** is a meaningful name that takes the place of a literal and retains the same value throughout the program, as opposed to variable, whose value may change.
 

```java
int test = 8;
```
The literal is 8, but the variable is `test`. `test` HOLDS the literal 8 until it is changed.  
  
A CONSTANT should have **"final"** keyword, which means that it doesn't change.
Also, it is convention (but not required) that a constant be all capital letters (for naming purposes).  
The following are vaild constants:

```java
final int WIDTH = 640;
static final height = 480;
public static final int TheConstant = 131;
```
