//what is "native" keyword though
//The native keyword is applied to a method to indicate that the method is implemented in native code using JNI (Java Native Interface). 
//native is a modifier applicable only for methods and we canâ€™t apply it anywhere else. 
//The methods which are implemented in C, C++ are called as native methods or foreign methods
